    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>0.25 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1.5 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>2/3 cup milk</li>
        <li>0.5 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat eggs and sugar together in a bowl using an electric mixer on medium speed until well blended.</li>
        <li>Mix flour and baking powder together in a separate bowl. Slowly mix into the sugar-egg mixture; batter will thicken rather quickly. Slowly add milk. Stir in vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
    </ol>
